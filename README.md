# 🚀 My Data Structures Learning Journey

This repository contains my practice and learning of **fundamental data structures in Java**.  
It includes implementations of **Stack** using different approaches and even **Stack using Queue**.

---

## 📚 Topics Covered

### 1️⃣ Stack using Array
- Implemented basic stack operations: `push`, `pop`, `peek`.
- Learned how `top` tracks the last element.
- Explored both **static** and **non-static** implementations.

### 2️⃣ Stack using ArrayList
- Used Java `ArrayList` to simulate stack behavior.
- Explored methods like `add`, `remove`, and `get`.

### 3️⃣ Stack using LinkedList
- Implemented stack using a custom `Node` class.
- Learned how `next` points to the next node and how `top` is updated.
- Practiced `push`, `pop`, and `peek`.
- Visualized stack as a chain of nodes.

### 4️⃣ Stack using Queue
- Implemented **stack behavior (LIFO)** using **Queue (`LinkedList`)**.
- Learned how rotating elements in a queue simulates stack’s `push` and `pop`.
- Compared stack methods vs queue methods (`add`, `remove`, `peek`).

## 🔑 Key Learnings

- Difference between **LIFO (Stack)** and **FIFO (Queue)**.
- How to implement a stack using **Array**, **ArrayList**, **LinkedList**, and **Queue**.
- Manipulating `top` pointer in LinkedList-based stack.
- Understanding Java Collection methods for **Stack** and **Queue**.
- Stack using queue rotation logic.
